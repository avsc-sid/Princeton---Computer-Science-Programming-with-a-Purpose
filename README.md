Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose - Princeton University
by Prof. Robert Sedgewick, Princeton University, Dr. Kevin Wayne, Princeton University

An excellent free course offered on Coursera by Princeton University for learning JAVA programming with practical applications.

Though I already learnt JAVA as part of the schools' curriculum, the practical application exercises are an excellent experience. And of course the instruction by Princeton's professor gives cool overarching concepts and strategic implementation of core programming principles. He moves beyond foundational syntax and focuses on real-world problem-solving.

I loved it. Thanks Princeton!
